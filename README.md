Before developing this bot I conducted market research to understand the customer and owner requirements.

Features I added were:
1)	Direct upload list of an item's photos: Some customers said instead of explicitly ordering the items from the Telegram e-commerce bot by choosing each and every item, can’t we just send the photo to the owner? So, I coded up the bot by including this feature.
2)	Category-wise selection: Instead of searching each and every item from the main menu, it’s helpful to customers if they get one category's worth of items together. So, while ordering, customers don’t forget any item.
3)	The owner can hire a delivery guy: I included a command called work to let customers apply for a delivery guy's job if they were interested.
4)	Dynamic changes in the list of items available: Since the items that a general store sells can be changed based on various factors like profit, loss, number of customers, etc. I coded the bot such that we can easily add or remove new items.
5)	Auto Keyboard Switching: I implemented auto keyboard switching from the item-button keyboard to the qwerty keyboard and vice versa whenever needed.
6)	Taking feedback: Feedback is the most important thing in business. So I gave the customer the option to provide feedback. So that owner takes it into consideration and improves their business.
7)	Commands: I provided various commands to handle the conversation between the customer and the bot. E.g :
    	/start: to start shopping and get all the categories available as buttons.
    	/myCart: to view customers' cart
    	/place: to place the order.
    	/work: to provide customers with the opportunity to apply for delivery jobs.
    	/more: to continue shopping
    	/help: to display all these commands and note
    	/feedback : to give feedback
8)	Cart availability: The customer can view their cart by entering the command or clicking the cart button, which is available on every button keyboard I provided.
9)	Easy removal and ordering of an item: While removing an item from the cart, the customer shouldn’t remember all the items in their cart because I’ll provide their cart and specify the item name, quantity they ordered, price of that item, and total cost implicitly. So he can remove an item easily and also remove only a specific number of items. When it comes to ordering, it’s very simple. You can either send a photo or go with interactive, category-wise shopping.
10)	Greeting: A good greeting at the start and end of the shopping trip will make the customer feel somewhat better.
11)	Interactive way of online shopping: A simple and interactive way of online shopping with pleasant button sounds, images, emojis, and gifs.
